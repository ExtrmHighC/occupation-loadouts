# occupation-loadouts
A basic standalone FiveM C# resource that gives the player a loadout based on their occupation in RP!

In-Game Commands / Usage!

/loadouts -- Displays all loadout aptions!

/leolo -- Gives a police loadout!

/crimelo -- Gives a criminal loadout!

/clearlo -- Clears all weapons from weapon wheel!

Please edit this resource based on your servers needs! This isn't really meant to just be copy / pasted into your resources folder. This is a very basic C# resource I decided to make using my current C# understanding (which is not the best). 

Feel free to edit and make changes! All I ask is that if you're going to re-release this, please give credit where credit is due!

# occupation-loadouts
A basic standalone FiveM C# resource that gives the player a loadout based on their occupation in RP!

In-Game Commands / Usage!

/loadouts -- Displays all loadout aptions!

/leolo -- Gives a police loadout!

/crimelo -- Gives a criminal loadout!

/swatlo -- Gives a swat loadout!

/clearlo -- Clears all weapons from weapon wheel!

Note: The commands in which give the player weapons cannot be spammed for adding insane ammounts of ammo, it resets your ammo count each time the command is executed.

Please edit this resource based on your servers needs! This isn't really meant to just be copy / pasted into your resources folder. This is a very basic C# resource I decided to make using my current C# understanding (which is not the best). 

Feel free to edit and make changes! All I ask is that if you're going to re-release this, please give credit where credit is due!
